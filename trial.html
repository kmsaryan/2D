      <h2>my thoughts </h2>
	  <hr>
      <p>i belive life is not about earning.its about living.it is jounery of joy,sucess and lots more.harships are part of life,problems are passing clouds.every moment happned leaves some mark or tell something.setbacks,downfalls ,loneliness depression.they were days where i stopped.but i didn't gaveup on life.i worked harder and harder.fought with my thoughts,</p>
	  <br>
	  <p>as a kid,i enjoyed lot of freedom from parents.they never spoke a word.and i was open to them.i was an average student at school.a little socialand not much playful i enjoyed schooling.in the end the school gave me good friends.but it was not same with college.they were some challenging days.lecturers were good with me,they hepled me alot during my college.and i had no remarks during my secondary education.things changed in glimpse,at my engineering. i got into an university which was quite new experience.a lot of exposure,i felt like i was thrown into an ocean my fellow students treated me differently,they tend to tease me alot or play practical jokes on me.it was due to the way i think.they were some times where i didn't realise i was being teased. some people supported me some said i am intellectual,straight,forward etc.</p>
    <h2>words about mother</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>for one birthday i asked many gifts.then my mom bought them and wrote others name.i belived that..after some years mother let the truth out.she does whatever i asked to make me happy. i am bad at decisions,so i seek mother for advices and decisions.she knows what's best for me.she stands for me.in every situation.and she is good cook too.i tease her dishs for fun.i often play with her alot.she got a lot of expectations.gardening,embroidery,arts,singing,dance alot more are her hobbies and a great student too.she ranked 3 in medical eamcet.she aspired to become a doctor but due to some circumtances she didn't achived many goals.she didn't stopped.and at present she owns business.and was known by many people.</p>
